A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication.

A service mesh is consisted of control plane and data plane.

* The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent proxies (Envoy) deployed as sidecars.
* The control plane manages and configures the proxies to route traffic.
