# Abstract

**Databricks** is a company that provides a cloud-based platform for data
engineering, data science, machine learning, and analytics. Their platform, also
called Databricks, is built on top of Apache Spark, an open-source distributed
computing framework designed to process large-scale data. The platform offers a
unified workspace for data processing, collaborative notebook environment, and
tools for visualizing and managing data pipelines. Databricks aims to simplify
big data processing and help organizations derive insights from their data more
quickly and efficiently.

# Databricks Lakehouse

**Databricks Lakehouse** is a specific solution offered by Databricks. It refers
to their architecture that combines the best features of **data lakes** and
**data warehouses** to create a unified platform. This platform caters to
diverse data needs, including data engineering, data science, machine learning,
and analytics.

**Databricks Lakehouse** is built on several key technologies, such as:

- **Apache Spark**: A fast and general-purpose cluster-computing system for big
  data processing and machine learning.
- **Delta Lake**: An open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions,
  scalability, and reliability to data lakes.
- **MLflow**: An open-source platform for machine learning lifecycle management.

These technologies, combined with Databricks' cloud-based platform, enable
organizations to store, process, and analyze large volumes of data, both
structured and unstructured, in a single, cost-effective, and high-performance
unified solution. The Lakehouse paradigm aims to simplify data management and
accelerate the generation of valuable insights from data.
