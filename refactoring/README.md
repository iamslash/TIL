# Abstract

**Refactoring** is the process of improving the design, structure, or implementation
of code without altering its external behavior or functionality. It involves
reorganizing, cleaning up, and optimizing existing code to make it more
readable, maintainable, and efficient, while ensuring that it still produces the
same results. Refactoring can involve activities such as simplifying logic,
removing code duplication, renaming variables and functions for clarity, and
improving code organization and modularity.
