# Relational Database Features

* Not suited for unstructured data
* Not suited for Big Data applications
* Big Data means huge volumes of data or high frequency data

# NoSQL Database Features

* Not-Only-SQL
* Non-relational in nature
* Support unstructured data
* Well suited for big data applications

# BigData Features

* Volume
  * Large volumes of data
* Velocity
  * Hube number of concurrent read/write operations in real time
* Variety
  * largely unstructured or semi-structured data

# SQL applications

MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, SQLite, Postgres, and MariaDB.

# NoSQL applications

* Wide-Column Databases : Cassandra, HBase
* Key-Value Stores : Redis, Voldemort, **DynamoDB**
* Graph Databases : Neo4J, InfiniteGraph
* Document Databases : CouchDB, MongoDB, **DynamoDB**

| Subject | SQL | NoSQL |
|:--------|:----|:------|
| Schema  | Strict schema | schema or schemaless |
| Querying  | SQL | some of SQL or UnSQL (Unstructured SQL) |
| Scalability | scale-up | scale-out |
| Reliability or ACID Compliancy (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Stric ACID | Some of ACID |
