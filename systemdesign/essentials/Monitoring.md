# Abstract

This is about a constructing Monitoring system. We should have a Metric, Logger,Alert, Tracing system for robust monitoring.

* Applications should route logs to somewhere and Log-viewer shows routed logs.
* Applications should route metrics to somewhere and Metric-viewer such as [Grafana](/grafana/README.md) shows routed metrics.
* If an incident happened, Alterting solution should email or call.
* We should trace API calls for debugging.
