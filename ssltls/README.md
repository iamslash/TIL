SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer whereas TLS refers to Transport Layer Security.  Basically, they are one and the same, but, entirely different.

How similar both are? SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols that authenticate data transfer between servers, systems, applications and users. For example, a cryptographic protocol encrypts the data that is exchanged between a web server and a user.

SSL was a first of its kind of cryptographic protocol. TLS on the other hand, was a recent upgraded version of SSL.
