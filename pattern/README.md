# [GOF Pattern](http://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns)
  
- Creational Pattern
  - Abstract Factory	(Creates an instance of several families of classes)
  - Builder	(Separates object construction from its representation)
  - Factory Method	(Creates an instance of several derived classes)
  - Prototype	(A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned)
  - Singleton	(A class of which only a single instance can exist)    

- Structural Pattern
  - Adapter	(Match interfaces of different classes)
  - Bridge	(Separates an object’s interface from its implementation)
  - Composite	(A tree structure of simple and composite objects)
  - Decorator	(Add responsibilities to objects dynamically)
  - Facade	(A single class that represents an entire subsystem)
  - Flyweight	(A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing)
  - Proxy	(An object representing another object)

- Behaviorial Pattern
  - Chain of Resp.	(A way of passing a request between a chain of objects)
  - Command	(Encapsulate a command request as an object)
  - Interpreter	(A way to include language elements in a program)
  - Iterator	(Sequentially access the elements of a collection)
  - Mediator	(Defines simplified communication between classes)
  - Memento	(Capture and restore an object's internal state)
  - Observer	(A way of notifying change to a number of classes)
  - State	(Alter an object's behavior when its state changes)
  - Strategy	(Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class)
  - Template (Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass)
  - Visitor	(Defines a new operation to a class without change)
